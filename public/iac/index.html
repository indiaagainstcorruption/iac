				There is a plenty of technology available but still its application is day to day life to solve common problems is not very common. In this hack, we are trying to solve one recently faced problem

				Problem: There is a big media outage in anti corruption movement led by Mr Anna Haraza. Its hard for people to know whats going on and even hard to promote the moment. A country like India with over 121 Milion Internet users (<a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm">http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm</a>), intenet play an important role.

				Solution: A tool/plugin which can be easily installed on any website and notify people its visitors about the movement. This tool can be used by the blogger, website owners to promote and express their interest towards the movement.

				It can also be used to show latest highlights about the event.
